<h2>The science behind climate suitability modelling</h2>
<p>
CliMAS Suitability uses vertebrate observation records from the Atlas of Living Australia database to generate current and future species distribution models. These are built for each of 4 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, analogous to greenhouse gas emission scenarios) using the mid-point of 18 global climate models (GCMs) at decadal time steps between 2015 and 2085.

<h3>Preparing observation records for modelling</h3>
<p>
Bird, mammal, amphibian and reptile observation records retrieved from the Atlas of Living Australia's (ALA) database have been filtered to exclude records with obvious issues. BirdLife Australia provided detailed species range information that allowed us to model only bird observation records that fall within core habitat.  Expert researchers from James Cook University vetted the data for mammals, amphibians and reptiles.

Only species with >10 unique location records are modeled.

<h3>Acquiring and generating current and future climate data</h3>
<p>
We used climate data from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) to caculate important climate variables such as current annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, and annual precipitation. We calculated likely future climate for each climate variable considered important to vertebrate distributions using all 18 global climate models (GCMs) for all RCP scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, RCP8.5) at 8 time steps between 2015 and 2085.

<h3>Generating climate suitability maps</h3>
<p>
Climate suitability maps for a species represent what scientists call a Species Distribution Model. These models shows the relationship between where species have currently been observed and the climate at that location. Once the relationship between climate and observations is known, it can be projected into the future using GCMs.
</p><p>
CliMAS Suitability shows all potentially suitable climate space, even if the species has not been observed there, or could not realistically move there in the future.  We show this because species can be relocated, intentionally (sometimes for their preservation) or unintentionally (where they may become pests).
