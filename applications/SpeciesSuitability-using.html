<h2>How to use this tool</h2>
<p>
CliMAS Suitability performs three roles:
</p><ul>
<li>
    show relationship between species distributions and climate currently, and how this may change in the future
</li><li>
    show how differing amounts of greenhouse gas emissions impact individual vertebrate species
</li><li>
    visualise degree of overlap between each of 18 different Global Climate Models
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing current climate suitability for a species</h3>
<p>
CliMAS Suitability starts by showing you a search box across the top of a map.
</p><p>
Type a species of your choice into the search box. As you type CliMAS Suitability will pop up a list suggesting matching species; when you see the species you are looking for, click its name (or use your arrow and Enter keys to select it).
</p><p>
The current suitability map will be displayed.
</p><p>
If you are already viewing a species, you can type a new species straight into the search box
</p>
<h3>Viewing future climate suitability for a species</h3>
<p>
The drop down menu beneath ‘view on map’ allows you to view future data.  Upon selecting ‘future’ from this menu, the drop down menus for ‘scenario’, ‘model’, and ‘time’ will become active.
</p><p>
To view our best estimate of the current trajectory, select:
</p><dl>
    <dt>scenario:</dt><dd>RCP85</dd>
    <dt>model:</dt><dd>best estimate</dd>
</dl><p>
Then choose a year.  Median represents the mid-point of the 18 Global Climate Models.
</p>
<h3>Exploring amounts of greenhouse gas emissions</h3>
<p>
CliMAS Suitability allows visitors to see how each of four predefined levels of greenhouse gas emissions impact climate space available for a species.  These scenarios range from very low emissions (RCP3PD)  to high (RCP85 - business as usual).
</p><p>
To view our best estimate of four different possible futures, select:
</p><dl>
    <dt>scenario:</dt><dd>your choice</dd>
    <dt>model:</dt><dd>Median</dd>
    <dt>year:</dt><dd>your choice</dd>
</dl></p>
<h3>Examining model overlap</h3>
<p>
‘Uncertainty’ between models is often cited during climate change discussion, but what does this uncertainty look like?
</p><p>
CliMAS Suitability shows visitors the effect of 18 different climate models on the climate space of each species, allowing users to see how models overlap in their projection of future climate space.
</p><p>
To view how each different model projects climate space for a species, select:
</p><dl>
    <dt>scenario:</dt><dd>your choice</dd>
    <dt>model:</dt><dd>your choice</dd>
    <dt>year:</dt><dd>your choice</dd>
</dl>
