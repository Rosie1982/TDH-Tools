<h2>How to use this tool</h2>
<p>
CliMAS Biodiversity shows the relationship between biodiversity patterns and climate currently, and how this may change in the future
</p>
<h3>Viewing biodiversity patterns</h3>
<p>
CliMAS Biodiversity starts by showing you a menu that allows you to choose between vertebrate classes: birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles.
</p><p>
Once you have selected a class, a menu that allows you to choose families or genera will become active.  If you choose family or genera, a drop down menu will appear that will allow your to choose a family or genera.
</p><p>
Select a year.
</p><p>
To view our best estimate of the current trajectory, use the default emissions scenario (RCP8.5).
</p><p>
The biodiversity map will be displayed as a popup.
</p>
<h3>Viewing effect of greenhouse gas emissions on biodiversity patterns</h3>
<p>
CliMAS Biodiversity not only allows you to view changes in patterns over time, it displays interaction between time and different emissions trajectories.  To view how much a decrease in emissions can impact the future of biodiversity, select any of the lower emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, or RCP6).
