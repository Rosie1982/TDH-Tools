<h2>About this tool</h2>
<p>
CliMAS Biodiversity is a website where visitors can examine current patterns of biodiversity of Australian vertebrate species and how models project biodiversity to change in the future.
</p><p>
It shows biodiversity maps for all birds, reptiles, frogs and mammals and their families and genera, with the suitable climate space projected by 18 different Global Climate Models (GCMs) and four potential emissions scenarios (RCPs) from 2015 to 2085.
</p><p>
This enables visitors to examine how much biodiversity can be impacted by a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
Currently there is a general lack of engagement and knowledge transfer between professional researchers and end-users of research (general public, conservation managers, decision-makers, etc.). This is reflected in a general lack of acceptance and acknowledgement by the public and stakeholders of the potential impacts of climate change, particularly on biodiversity.
</p><p>
Recently, researchers have begun to endeavour to make the results of their research public, however there is a scarcity online tools that display species distribution data.  CliMAS Biodiversity site provides a tool that reuses data available with Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Tropical Data Hub to allow a broad range of end-users to explore the potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial vertebrate species in Australia.
