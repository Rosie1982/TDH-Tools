Lady & Gents,

I have place a sample model run for the Gouldian Finch (GOULFINC) in /home/ctbccr/TDH/ . In the GOULFINC directory are 2 files:

1.	occur.csv -- simple csv file with 3 columns representing species, lat, long

2.	modelspp.sh -- sample shell script to create the distribution model and project onto all current & future climate predictions
The shell script can be submitted to the HPC queue using "qsub modelspp.sh" the job will run. Use the command qstat to check status
of job run and/or look in the output directory for progress.


Things to note:
1.	this is the basic model / projecting run. There will be additional R scripts for summarization / checking / aggregation that will be added later
    but the basic input & outputs are defined / exemplified here.

2.	climate projection names... 1975 represents current but for all others is a simple split on the '.' where the values
    represent emission scenario, global climate model, replicate run for current, replicate run for future and time into
    future data is for (respectively).

3.	all files generated will be in the output directory... thus delete / rename this dir if you want to rerun the script
Cheers,

Jeremy

Bioclimatic variables are derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values in order to generate more biologically meaningful variables. These are often used in ecological niche modeling (e.g., BIOCLIM, GARP). The bioclimatic variables represent annual trends (e.g., mean annual temperature, annual precipitation) seasonality (e.g., annual range in temperature and precipitation) and extreme or limiting environmental factors (e.g., temperature of the coldest and warmest month, and precipitation of the wet and dry quarters). A quarter is a period of three months (1/4 of the year).

They are coded as follows:

BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature
BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp))
BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (* 100)
BIO4 = Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100)
BIO5 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month
BIO6 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month
BIO7 = Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6)
BIO8 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter
BIO9 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter
BIO10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter
BIO11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter
BIO12 = Annual Precipitation
BIO13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month
BIO14 = Precipitation of Driest Month
BIO15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation)
BIO16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter
BIO17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter
BIO18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter
BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter

This scheme follows that of ANUCLIM, except that for temperature seasonality the standard deviation was used because a coefficient of variation does not make sense with temperatures between -1 and 1).

This AML (Arc-Info workstation script) was used to generate these layers.
You can also use the 'biovars' method in the R package dismo
