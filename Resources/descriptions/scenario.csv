RCP3PD,"Low RCP with Peak & Decline (2005-2500)","The RCP 3-PD is developed by the IMAGE modeling team of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. The emission pathway is representative for scenarios in the literature leading to very low greenhouse gas concentration levels. It is a so-called peak scenario its radiative forcing level first reaches a value around 3.1 W/m2 mid-century returning to 2.6 W/m2 by 2100. In order to reach such radiative forcing levels greenhouse gas emissions (and indirectly emissions of air pollutants) Are reduced substantially over time. The final RCP is based on the publication by Van Vuuren et al. (2007).",http//www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome
RCP45,"Medium-Low RCP with stabilisation from 2150 onwards (2005-2500)","The RCP 4.5 is developed by the MiniCAM modeling team at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratorys Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI). It is a stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 by employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The scenario drivers and technology options are detailed in Clarke et al. (2007). Additional detail on the simulation of land use and terrestrial carbon emissions is given by Wise et al (2009).",http//www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome
RCP6,"Medium-High RCP with stabilisation from 2150 onwards (2005-2500)","The RCP 6.0 is developed by the AIM modeling team at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) Japan. It is a stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized after 2100 without overshoot by employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The details of the scenario are described in Fujino et al. (2006) And Hijioka et al. (2008).",http//www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome
RCP85,"High RCP","stabilising emissions post-2100 concentrations post-2200 (2005-2500) The RCP 8.5 is developed by the MESSAGE modeling team and the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework at the International Institute for Applies Systems Analysis (IIASA) Austria. The RCP 8.5 is characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time representative for scenarios in the literature leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels. The underlying scenario drivers and resulting development path are based on the A2r scenario detailed in Riahi et al. (2007).",http//www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=welcome
